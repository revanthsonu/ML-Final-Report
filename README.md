# Dynamic Domain Knowledge Incorporation for LLMs

## Overview

This project implements a framework for dynamically incorporating knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically in the financial domain.  It addresses the challenge of keeping LLMs up-to-date with rapidly changing information by allowing for real-time updates to the LLM's knowledge base.

## Key Features

* **Knowledge Base:** Stores and manages domain-specific knowledge (financial data in this case).
* **LLM Runtime:** Integrates a Hugging Face LLM and uses the KnowledgeBase to provide context for queries.
* **Knowledge Loader:** Dynamically loads, validates, and optimizes knowledge from external sources.
* **Multi-threading:** Uses concurrent processing for efficient knowledge updates and query handling.

## Technical Details

The framework is implemented in Python using:

* Hugging Face Transformers
* PyTorch
* REST API
* JSON
* Threading

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Install the required libraries:** `pip install transformers torch`
3.  Run the main script

## Usage

The script simulates a financial LLM system.  It first loads initial financial knowledge, then processes user queries, and simulates dynamic knowledge updates.

## Example

```python
python main.py
